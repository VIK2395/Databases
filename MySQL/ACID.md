ACID

- Atomicity (No intermediate state, the whole transaction succeeds or rollbacks)
- Consistency (Transaction brings data from one consistent state to another one, e.g. constrains, data types, so on are always meet)
- Isolation (Eliminate concurrency, race condition problems. Each transaction is executed in isolation from the others. Isolation Levels and Locks)
- Durability (Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure)

Integrity - цілісність
